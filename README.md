
# Jacobi Algorithm

Python code implementing the Jacobi algorithm (An example of an iterative method)

This project has been created for: 
ECM3428 - Algorithms that Changed the World


## Pre-Requisite Libraries

This project uses the numpy library for arrays. This module must be installed by the user as a pre-requisite.


## Usage

python JacobiAlgorithm [OptionalFileName]

Running the program without any system arguments will generate random, valid inputs and perform the Jacobi algorithm on them.

Running the program with a valid filename as an argument (adhering to the format shown in the provided InputFile.txt) 
will use those inputs instead (after testing that they are valid and the Jacobi algorithm will converge).
